# PyIAMKit

PyIAMKit is a modular, framework-agnostic Python foundation for Identity and Access Management (IAM), RBAC, multi-tenancy, policy-based authorization, delegation, auditability and durable persistence.

> **Status:** Django integration beta (`0.4.0b3`) — not yet recommended for production use.

## Goals

PyIAMKit is designed around default deny, least privilege, explicit tenant/scope boundaries, explainable authorization, strong revocation and framework-independent domain logic.

## Current milestone

`0.4.0b3` adds the first **Django integration** as an optional, synchronous adapter.

```text
Django HttpRequest
       ↓
Bearer token
       ↓
TokenProvider.verify_access_token()
       ↓
AccessTokenClaims
       ↓
explicit Tenant / Scope / Resource resolvers
       ↓
AuthorizationEngine
       ↓
view execution / 401 / 403 / step-up 403
```

Two protection styles are available:

- `bearer_required()` for authentication-only views;
- `permission_required()` for Authentication + PyIAMKit Authorization.

An optional `PyIAMKitAuthenticationMiddleware` can attach verified claims to requests that already carry a Bearer header, but it does **not** globally make public routes private.

PyIAMKit deliberately does not treat Django `request.user`, Django groups, Django permissions, `is_staff` or `is_superuser` as IAM authorization truth. Applications that need interoperability must implement explicit mapping/provisioning rules.

The adapter is sync-first. Async Django views are rejected explicitly until PyIAMKit exposes async-safe persistence/application services.

## Installation

Python 3.12+ is required.

Core only:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

SQLAlchemy persistence with SQLite or another SQLAlchemy-supported backend:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[sqlalchemy]"
```

PostgreSQL persistence with psycopg:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[postgres]"
```

JWT access-token adapter:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[jwt]"
```

OIDC federation adapter with configured keys:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[oidc]"
```

OIDC Discovery + remote JWKS:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[oidc-http]"
```

TOTP MFA:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[mfa]"
```

FastAPI integration:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[fastapi]"
```

Django integration:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[django]"
```

FastAPI + JWT:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[jwt,fastapi]"
```

Development checks:

```bash
python -m pip install build mypy pytest pytest-cov ruff
make check
```

Authentication context
       ↓
AuthorizationRequest / host application context
       ↓
AuthorizationEngine
       ↓
AuthorizationDecision + Audit
```

The Authentication domain does not import SQLAlchemy, psycopg, JWT libraries, FastAPI, Django or an external IdP SDK. Persistence and future token/federation integrations depend inward on Authentication contracts.

## Django integration guarantees in 0.4.0b3

- qualified against Django 5.2.x and 6.1.x;
- Bearer verification delegated to `TokenProvider`;
- permission decisions delegated to `AuthorizationEngine`;
- explicit Tenant resolver required for authorization;
- anonymous public requests remain possible with middleware installed;
- missing/invalid protected Bearer requests return 401 + `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`;
- ordinary authorization denial remains generic 403;
- step-up-required remains structured 403;
- Django User/groups/permissions/superuser flags are not implicit IAM bypasses;
- sync-only contract is explicit; async views fail configuration rather than running unsafe sync I/O.
